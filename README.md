The following files provide brief summaries of user microtransactions performed within the free-to-play video game "Heroes of Pymoli." Information includes the size of player-base, as well as age and gender demographics.  We can infer a few things about the transactions based on the analysis provided:
The player-base is largely male; Of the 576 total players stored in the data, 484 of them are Male (~84% of the total).
The total number of purchases are made by males.  However, this is to be expected, due to the fact that 84% of players are male.  However, if we evaluate the average purchase price and the average purchase price per person, we observe that females contain the highest value in both instances (albeit by only ~20 to 40 cents).
The player-base is also mostly 20 to 24 years of age (accounting for ~44% of the total).  Therefore, we see the highest number of purchases from this age-group.  However, the age-group with the highest average purchase per person is 35-39 (perhaps most likely due to having a little more disposable income than the younger groups).
